        <img src="images/profile.webp" alt="Jean Marc Kanda" width="200">
        <p>My name is Jean Marc Kanda, and I’m a motivated, curious, and open-minded individual who thrives on
            continuous learning
            and meaningful connections. I’m deeply passionate about technology, creativity, and personal growth, and I
            enjoy
            exploring innovative ideas that inspire positive change.

            I love working on projects that make a real impact, whether by solving problems, improving people’s lives,
            or
            encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing. For me, growth comes not only from learning new skills but
            also from
            listening, exchanging ideas, and building relationships with others.

            In everything I do, I strive to remain positive, respectful, and empathetic, believing that effort and
            kindness are
            powerful tools for progress. I truly believe that when we work together with purpose and compassion, we can
            create
            something meaningful, lasting, and inspiring.</p>

        <p>The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a vast and diverse country located in the heart of Central
            Africa. Rich in
            natural resources, it is home to some of the world’s largest reserves of minerals such as cobalt, copper,
            and diamonds,
            as well as lush rainforests and the mighty Congo River, the second-longest river in Africa.</p>
